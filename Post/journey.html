                    <p>Like a lot of other mechanical keyboard enthusiast I had a modest start. The first mechanical keyboard I touched was a Razer Blackwidow that I tried in a shop. I was in awe. It was the first time I was laying my fingers on mechanical
                        switches and I immediately told to myself that I had to get one.</p>
                    <p>At that time I had just finished college and I was about to leave Mauritius for my tertiary studies in France. I meditated for long that day on the idea to buy it on the spot but decided to wait till I got in France. A week later I
                        found the Nightfox that was on Group Buy phase 4 on Input Club and decided to hop in.</p>
                    <p>The first time in my life that I had to wait 5 months to get a product I ordered, what a way to learn patience. Another 2 months later I was off in plane for France. There my new keyboard was waiting for me at my Aunt's place.</p>
                    <p>My first reaction was disappointment, yes you read that right. Preference was something I was not acquainted with at that time and the Halo Trues in my Nightfox were definitely no my gig. But I wasn't aware of that at the time and
                        got used to the switches. But truth be told, I ended up liking my little Nightfox very much and used it for nearly 6 month until I decided that I wanted to change the keycaps.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Finding out r/MK</h2>
                    <p>And here rabbit hole begins.</p>
                    <p>I begun scouting the web for a nice set of keycaps and as all of us at first, was baffled by the price tag of a good set of keycaps. I was sure not prepared to see some pieces of plastic cost as much as my first mechanical keyboard
                        that, at that time, found already quite expensive.</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <p class="mb-0">On a side note, this hobby really changes us and our conception of the word "expensive".</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>I found out that my switches, having pre-retooled box stems, had a tendancy to "destroy" keysets to say the least. I was really disappointed and decided to sell the Nightfox.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I was now on my search for a suitable replacement and scouting r/MK and the internet I discovered MKBDFR, the French mechanical keyboard community. I joined it and got good advice for my replacement keyboard. Now with more knowledge
                        aquired I decided to get myself a Tofu from KBDFan which I built with zealios v1 that I lubbed together with my girlfriend.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">It never ends</h2>
                    <p>You might think that getting my first real custom mechanical keyboard, I would stop there. I thought it too.</p><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/post/journey/journey-post.jpg" alt="KbdFans Tofu mechanical keyboard with epbt 9009" title="Tofu mechanical keyboard">
                    <span
                        class="caption text-muted">Tofu HHKB &amp; Epbt 9009 &amp; Zealios v1</span>
                        <p>It was also during that time that I got the chance to attend a meetup with other enthusiasts near Paris. Meeting people that share the same passion as you is truly an experience to live. I had a great time and learned a lot about
                            my own switch preferences during those meetup.</p>
                        <p>I sold my Tofu nearly two month later and hopped in my first Group Buy, the Polaris. Writing on my journey now I realise how erratic it was because I sold my Polaris spot some time later to get a TGR X SINGA Unikorn, but that's
                            a story for another time.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Fast Forward to now</h2>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Today&nbsp;I owned 6 keyboards&nbsp;in total and kept 3. My journey that had begun 3 years ago in a Computer Hardware shop has culminated in a passion like no other. I'm thankful to the French Community for the Friends I got to
                            make at the meetups and making something as uncommon as Keyboards a hobby. For those interested in taking a look at the events or searching for advices, i'm dropping an invite link below.</p>
