                    <p>Korean Customs or Kustoms are considered the OG, the root of mechanical keyboards. Korea was for a long time the home of the Custom Mechanical keyboard comunity and a lot of development was pioneered by them.</p>
                    <p>Since joining the hobby, Kustoms eluded me. I wanted to give them a go and as the impulsive buyer that I am, one evening I bought one on mechmarket. A silver Orion V3 in "used" condition. More on that later.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">First Impression</h2>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>I definitely didn’t get the Duck unboxing experience, mine came in some shady bubble wrap tapped just enough to be accepted as a parcel by the Post Services. I don't even know how it came to me unscathed as i could feel the aluminium
                        though the bubble wrap.</p>
                    <p>I was also quite disappointed by the damage made by the previous owner. The F row bears scratches, i guess he was too lazy to unscrew and remove the plate while desoldering the switches. Well too bad for me, in my impulsivity i didn't
                        bother to ask for pictures as he described the keyboard as "used". Well lesson of the story there are untrustworthy people on mechmarket and always ask for pictures of damages before buying. But i'm a positive guy and the marks
                        are at worst ano discoloration as they don't feel like scratches, anodising the board will fix it.</p>
                    <p>Getting over the scratches, the finish is really well done, Duck is known as a master of anodisation and for a reason. The anodisation looks crisp and is smooth, i would say it's best in class.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading"><strong>Building Experience</strong></h2>
                    <p>Duck is an established designer at that point and knows his stuff. The case is simple to put together. After soldering the the switches, you screw the plate to the top and align it properly. The tricky part with Ducks is the alignment
                        of the top and bottom part while holding the acrylic diffusers in place. My solution to this was to tape the acrylic diffuser to the bottom, it kept them in place and makes disassembling and reassembling less a hassle.</p>
                    <p>I decided to use H1 switches on my build. For those who don't know, the H1 is a switch designed by HHHH (HingHingHongHing), a Korean keyboard maker,&nbsp; to reproduce the feel and sound of Vintage Cherry MX Blacks. Stock the springs
                        are too heavy for me, so i did a spring swap for Sprit 63.5g Slow Springs and lubed everything with 205g0.</p>
                    <p>I'm also using a third party PCB with my build, one criticism of mine would be the lack of daughter board for the LED indicators, this would ensure compatibility with a greater range of PCBs. I had to hack my way on mine to make those
                        work and also ended up adding an RGB strip to the layer indicators.</p>
                    <p>The switch plate is quite hard to work with, the tolerances are so strict that inserting switches kinda hurt my fingers. It's also worth noting that Gateron Inks didn't work properly, i would consider them incompatible with the Orion
                        Alu plate.</p>
                    <p>The H87a is a great PCB, fully programmable and VIA compatible. <em>VIA is a graphical user interface to program keyboards.</em> I guess using the OG Duck PCB would be easier but I'm so addicted to VIA those days that I bought one
                        while the duck was shipping.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Features &amp; Case Quality</h2>
                    <p>If you search for Ducks you'll find a recurring theme, the underglow, and it is amazing.</p>
                    <p>I'm not a fan of RGB but i have to admit that underglow still got me. The Acrylic diffusers lights up evenly on the front and the side grips double as side profile diffusers. In short really nice and it adds personality to the board.</p>
                    <p>Talking of personality, most Custom TKLs look nearly the same from the top. The Orion add lock and layer LEDs on the top that i think makes it look a little less like, just another TKL.</p>
                    <p>Case Quality is amazing as expected, the tolerance is strict and the case fits together nicely without too much fiddling. The 6061 Aluminium is top notch and adds a feeling of density to the pieces. Machining marks are virtually absent
                        and the finish is consistent throughout the inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I'm an advocate of heavy keyboards and being able to add an internal weight and insert on the back is really a bonus for me.</p>
